# How to Reset the Waste Ink Counters in Epson Printers with WIC Reset Utility
 
If you have an Epson printer that shows an error message like "The Printer's Ink Pads at the end of Their service life" or "A Printer's Ink Pad is at the end of Its service life", you may need to reset the waste ink counters in your printer. The waste ink counters are used to keep track of how much ink is used for cleaning the print head and other maintenance tasks. When the waste ink counters reach a certain limit, the printer will stop working to prevent ink leakage and damage.

One way to reset the waste ink counters is to use a software tool called WIC Reset Utility. This tool can help you reset the waste ink counters in most Epson inkjet printers with a few clicks. Here are the steps to use WIC Reset Utility:
 
1. Download WIC Reset Utility from [https://wic-reset.com/download](https://wic-reset.com/download). You can choose the version for Windows or Mac OS according to your operating system.
2. Install and run WIC Reset Utility on your computer. Make sure your Epson printer is connected and turned on.
3. Select your printer model from the drop-down list and click "Read waste counters" button. The tool will show you the current values of the waste ink counters.
4. If the waste ink counters are more than 100%, you need to reset them. To do that, you need to buy a reset key from [https://wic-reset.com/buy](https://wic-reset.com/buy). The reset key is a one-time use code that allows you to reset one printer.
5. After you buy the reset key, enter it in the "Enter reset key here" box and click "Reset waste counters" button. The tool will reset the waste ink counters and show you a confirmation message.
6. Turn off your printer and turn it on again. The error message should disappear and your printer should work normally.

Note: The WIC Reset Utility can only reset the waste ink counters, not the ink levels or other functions of your printer. You still need to replace or refill your ink cartridges when they are low or empty.

## How to Refill Epson Ink Cartridges with Edible Inks
 
If you have an Epson printer that uses edible inks for cake decorating, you may need to refill your ink cartridges from time to time. Edible inks are specially formulated food coloring that can be printed on edible paper or frosting sheets. You can buy edible ink cartridges or refillable cartridges that you can fill with edible ink bottles. Here are the steps to refill Epson cartridges with edible inks:

1. Hold or support the cartridge upright. Make sure the cartridge is not tilted or upside down.
2. Leave the yellow air hole tape in place. This tape allows air to enter the cartridge and prevents ink leakage.
3. Remove and keep the ink plug. You'll find a small rubber plug on the top of the cartridge. This is where you will inject the ink. Keep the plug somewhere safe so you can put it back later.
4. Securely attach a blunt needle to a 10 ml syringe and fill it with ink. You can use any blunt needle that fits the syringe. You can buy edible ink bottles from [https://www.ink4cakes.com/Edible-Ink-Cartridges\_c\_1.html](https://www.ink4cakes.com/Edible-Ink-Cartridges_c_1.html). Make sure to use the correct color for each cartridge.
5. Slowly fill the ink reservoir through the hole to roughly 5 mm from the top. Insert the needle into the hole on the cartridge and slowly push the plunger to inject the ink. Do not overfill the cartridge or it may leak.
6. Replace the ink plug and wipe off any excess ink. Put the rubber plug back into the hole and make sure it is sealed. Use a paper towel or a cloth to wipe off any ink that may have spilled on the cartridge.
7. Install the cartridge in your printer and run a nozzle check. Follow the instructions in Part 2 of this article to install your cartridge in your printer. Then, run a nozzle check to make sure the print head is working properly and there are no clogs or streaks.

Note: The edible ink cartridges are only for printing on edible paper or frosting sheets. Do not use them for printing on regular paper or other materials. Also, do not mix edible inks with regular inks or use them in printers that have been used with regular inks before.
